[{"categories":["blogs"],"contents":"Have you ever looked for a word in \u0026ldquo;The Official CHAMORRO-ENGLISH Dictionary\u0026rdquo;? If you have, perhaps you\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that the words aren\u0026rsquo;t sorted exactly according to i atfabetun Chamoru. Take for instance the following set of words pulled directly from the dictionary mentioned above\nHere we see that kamuti comes before k√•myu which comes before kana'. At first glance it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be an issue: \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; does come before \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;. But in the Chamorro alphabet, \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo; comes before \u0026ldquo;√•\u0026rdquo; and so all of the words that begin with \u0026ldquo;ka-\u0026rdquo; should come before all of the words that start with \u0026ldquo;k√•-\u0026rdquo;.\nTo be honest though, it\u0026rsquo;s not a huge problem. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to handle in real-time and, so long as the word exists in the dictionary, I tend to find what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for.\nHowever\u0026hellip;what if I wanted the words to be truly sorted?\nI ran into this predicament when I tried to sort my personal diksion√•rion Chamoru1 using Python. I took my entire set of words, loaded them into Python, and used their built-in sorted() function to sort everything. The results were\u0026hellip;confusing at first.\nLet me show you what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about - consider the following list of words:\nIn [1]: chamoru_words = [ ...: \u0026quot;√°tadok\u0026quot;, ...: \u0026quot;√•gang\u0026quot;, ...: \u0026quot;ha'a\u0026quot;, ...: \u0026quot;hagoi\u0026quot;, ...: \u0026quot;H√•fa\u0026quot;, ...: \u0026quot;h√•gu\u0026quot;, ...: \u0026quot;hilu'\u0026quot;, ...: \u0026quot;kant√•yi\u0026quot;, ...: \u0026quot;k√•nta\u0026quot;, ...: \u0026quot;nubena\u0026quot;, ...: \u0026quot;√±ateng\u0026quot;, ...: \u0026quot;√±√•lang\u0026quot;, ...: \u0026quot;ng√•nga'\u0026quot;, ...: \u0026quot;Yu'us\u0026quot;, ...: ] As typed out, this list is sorted in accordance with i atfabetun Chamoru. There isn\u0026rsquo;t a preference here for uppercase vs lowercase; things are simply sorted alphabetically. Now let\u0026rsquo;s run sorted() on it:\nIn [2]: sorted(chamoru_words) Out[2]: [ 'H√•fa', \u0026quot;Yu'us\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ha'a\u0026quot;, 'hagoi', \u0026quot;hilu'\u0026quot;, 'h√•gu', 'kant√•yi', 'k√•nta', \u0026quot;ng√•nga'\u0026quot;, 'nubena', '√°tadok', '√•gang', '√±ateng', '√±√•lang' ] The results are interesting but also expected - at least for Python. While this isn\u0026rsquo;t the exact same sorting as used in the blue dictionary, it does point out a problem: we can\u0026rsquo;t rely on \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; sorting procedures when working with Chamorro!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been (slowly, but surely) working on fine-tuning my dictionary and have been doing everything in Python. For me, the issue arose due to how Python\u0026rsquo;s sorted() function works: it uses the character\u0026rsquo;s Unicode decimal value2.\nThis is precisely why I created my own sorting algorithm. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at it in action:\nIn [1]: from orthography_helper import chamoru_sort In [2]: chamoru_words = [ ...: 'H√•fa', ...: \u0026quot;Yu'us\u0026quot;, ...: \u0026quot;ha'a\u0026quot;, ...: 'hagoi', ...: \u0026quot;hilu'\u0026quot;, ...: 'h√•gu', ...: 'kant√•yi', ...: 'k√•nta', ...: \u0026quot;ng√•nga'\u0026quot;, ...: 'nubena', ...: '√°tadok', ...: '√•gang', ...: '√±ateng', ...: '√±√•lang' ...: ] In [3]: sorted(chamoru_words, key=chamoru_sort) Out[3]: ['√°tadok', '√•gang', \u0026quot;ha'a\u0026quot;, 'hagoi', 'H√•fa', 'h√•gu', \u0026quot;hilu'\u0026quot;, 'kant√•yi', 'k√•nta', 'nubena', '√±ateng', '√±√•lang', \u0026quot;ng√•nga'\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Yu'us\u0026quot;] Success! Biba! Some things I want to point out are:\n Vowels and their accented counterparts hold the same value (e.g., a and √° will get sorted equally) Casing does not affect order n comes before √± which comes before ng. I may have to revist this one, primarily because I\u0026rsquo;m not 100% confident that all of the words in my dictionary are spelled \u0026ldquo;correctly\u0026rdquo; (e.g. I may have mangaigi instead of manggaigi)  I feel like I still have some work to do - it\u0026rsquo;s not as straight forward as I thought it would be! For instance: while they don\u0026rsquo;t adhere to i atfabetun Chamoru, what happens with family names? While perhaps not standard, I think it makes sense to have names like Aquiningoc and Quitugua appear in a dictionary - especially since we can pull out the Chamorro words they\u0026rsquo;re derived from!\nHopefully someday I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to fully share my work with you all. Unfortunately I can\u0026rsquo;t make my source code public yet - as an Apple employee I can\u0026rsquo;t just push my software out there for the world to utilize. There are legal rasons for this - but that\u0026rsquo;s a topic for another day!\nEnn√•o ha' para p√•\u0026rsquo;gu.

I had to take a step back from dang near everything and reasses my priorities and how I spend my time outside of work - hence my absence üòÖ.\nBUT it was much needed as I\u0026rsquo;m here now and ready to share a bit about what I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on, which is: a personal Chamoru dictionary stored on my computer. This project was born out of three \u0026ldquo;issues\u0026rdquo; I kept running into:\n My favorite go-to resource for looking up Chamoru words (LearningChamoru.com) required too many steps* There were a lot of words I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find when searching Number 1 seems to only reflect the Guam Orthography, and I wanted something \u0026ldquo;more complete\u0026rdquo; (i.e., something with words spelled using the CNMI orthography)  * Too many steps = opening a browser, clicking login, logging in, scrolling down to \u0026ldquo;Dictionary\u0026rdquo;, and then searching for a word.\nPues, hu tutuhun i hinanao-hu. I created a template of what I thought a dictionary would look like on the back-end (in a database) and I started gathering as many words as I could find. Anytime I came across a new word, I\u0026rsquo;d pop open my database and add it in there. It took an egregious amount of time but I finally got to a place where I felt comfortable enough to start working on a \u0026ldquo;front-end\u0026rdquo; to access the database. I put that in quotes because in it\u0026rsquo;s current state I can only access it from a terminal/command-line interface (CLI). I started it off this way sa' gi minag√•het, it\u0026rsquo;s where I live when I code. Also it\u0026rsquo;s the fastest way I can access the database. Essentially I created a small program that allows me to access it via the CLI.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a screenshot of me running the program: If you\u0026rsquo;re unfamiliar with what you\u0026rsquo;re looking at, it\u0026rsquo;s a terminal/CLI. The points of interest are the second line, where you see ‚îî‚îÄ $ sodda, and then the text afterwards. My program runs when I type sodda and hit enter. I get prompted for a word to search for (in this case I entered \u0026quot; tungo' \u0026ldquo;), and then if it finds something I get results back. Otherwise it says it can\u0026rsquo;t find the word and the prompts just continue until I exit.\nCleaning the data and structuring how everything is stored/returned actually took the most amount of time. I wrote a lot of small helper programs to do things like sort the words, remove misformed words, and add new words, but I still have a lot of work ahead of me. There are still ~3000 words I have that I need to add but don\u0026rsquo;t have exact translations for. There are also a bunch of words I just straight up don\u0026rsquo;t have either.\nTo give you a sense of how big this dictionary has gotten, here is where I\u0026rsquo;m at: Currently I store everything in a JSON file, where each word will take up roughly ~20-25 lines. This is near the bottom of the file and as you can see it\u0026rsquo;s around 340,000 lines (last I checked, there were ~17,000 words). Some functionality is still missing like a) being able to give an English word and get a Chamoru word back, and b) giving suggestions/alternative spellings to what you provided.\nHinasso-ku na sen pairi esti!\u0026hellip;lao\u0026hellip;there\u0026rsquo;s one potential problem. I haven\u0026rsquo;t put this out there yet for everyone to see and try because I actually don\u0026rsquo;t know if I legally can ü§î.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t mentioned this yet, and perhaps you were able to pick it up from earlier when I mentioned why I created this tool, but\u0026hellip;I didn\u0026rsquo;t create a majority of this information from scratch. I made use of LearningChamoru.com, news articles from the GuamPDN, and any blog I could find that seemed like a great resource for filling up a dictionary. So for example, let\u0026rsquo;s say you use this tool and look up the word \u0026ldquo;magof\u0026rdquo; - one of the definitions you\u0026rsquo;d get back is the same one you\u0026rsquo;d find in LearningChamoru.com, word-for-word.\nPues hunggan, as much as I want to share this right now, there are still some things I need to figure out.

It started off simple: try and find out who my great-grandparents were. I honestly didn\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;d get past that because before this I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even tell you the names of any of my great-grandparents. But as you\u0026rsquo;ll soon find out, my simple task turned into a research-heavy adventure which is still ongoing.\nThis wasn\u0026rsquo;t on my to-do list until recently - I\u0026rsquo;d say within the last 2 years. I never really thought about any family past my grandparents; I never wondered who their parents or grandparents were. I also gave little thought to who their siblings were. I mean, growing up it just wasn\u0026rsquo;t something that they talked about. I want to say that I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know if they had had any siblings, although that became apparent closer to when I was in high school and started meeting extended family. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be until the passing of my grandmas that I would start to pay more attention. And it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be until just about 2 years ago that I would start digging into my family history.\n| Note: I\u0026rsquo;ll refer to my grandparents as Grandma/Grandpa A and Grandma/Grandpa T; Aquiningoc and Taitingfong respectively.\n   Gathering Documents  The first event that really triggered my search was receiving documents about my mom\u0026rsquo;s side of the family. My aunt had been holding onto them from when she was cleaning house, and I guess she just never thought that it would be of any excitement to us. I recall asking about family names - clan names in particular - and she went to her room to retrieve all the stuff she had. When she came back I was astounded: she had birth certificates, death certificates, legal documents, obituaries, funeral pamphlets, social security cards, and a lot more. The documents that piqued my interest were the ones about my grandma A\u0026rsquo;s siblings and some homemade lineage documents for my grandpa A\u0026rsquo;s side. I saw \u0026ldquo;Aquiningoc\u0026rdquo; on that paper but none of the names looked remotely familiar.\nLater that week I asked my dad what he knew about his parents. He told me not much but that he would ask his siblings what they knew. Within a few hours my dad had text me some scans: a photo of my grandpa T\u0026rsquo;s mom, a photo of my grandma T and her grandma, and a homemade lineage document detailing my grandma T\u0026rsquo;s family.\nThe two lineage documents were incredible finds. The one for my grandma T started with her grandparents. It listed their kids and all the grandchildren. My grandma was one of those grandchildren. Success: I found a set of great-grandparents!\nThe one for my grandpa A was even more interesting. It was laid out in a similar fashion: grandparents at the top, children below, and grandchildren below that. But my grandpa wasn\u0026rsquo;t on this list\u0026hellip;his dad wasn\u0026rsquo;t even on the list. I would come to find out that it was my grandpa A\u0026rsquo;s grandpa listed\u0026hellip;as a grandchild! So not only did I find another set of great-grandparents, but a set of their great-grandparents.\n I was so amazed yet at the same time a bit sad. These were people I never learned about and, gi minag√•het, likely never will. I made a decision right there to document everything I could; to create something that I can pass down to my children and to my siblings and cousins and aunts and todu i manggaf√•-hu.\nI started writing down names on paper but that got out of hand quickly. Thus started my search for a tool I could easily use and (hopefully) easily share.\n   Finding the Right Tool  They say the best time to start something was yesterday; the next best time is right now. With that in mind I figured I\u0026rsquo;d start with a spreadsheet-like program, so I started working in Google Sheets. It started off easy because I had only noted down my immediate family and my grandparents from both sides. When it came to writing down my uncles and aunts though I started to realize that wow: this is going to get out of hand quickly; my dad is 1 of 10, my mom is 1 of 6\u0026hellip;I don\u0026rsquo;t know about my grandparents, but I knew from the documents I had that their families were also \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo;.\nWhile continuing to work in Google Sheets I started to also look for alternatives because what started as a 3 sheet file grew into 16 sheets\u0026hellip;and that was just going up my family tree, i.e., I was only tracing parents and their parents and their parents and etc. I was able to track i ma√±ain√•-hu back 6 generations. Things started getting complicated and I needed a new tool.\n\nI temporarily used MyHeritage because it was convenient \u0026amp; had a decent amount of data I could use. There also were people there that had connections to some of my great- and great-great-grandparents, and to be honest that was pretty cool. But MyHeritage had it\u0026rsquo;s limitations: the desktop app was great, but it felt like most of the magic was happening on the web-side; also, most of the data that I needed to fill in the gaps in my tree were behind paywalls.\nSidebar: I much prefer desktop apps as opposed to web apps. From a business perspective, I understand why web apps are more ubiquitous\u0026hellip;but I tend to opt for desktop.\nI paused on entering new data and went to search for a different tool. That\u0026rsquo;s when I came across Gramps, an open-source genealogical research software - it\u0026rsquo;s essentially a database (DB) with a decent GUI. This felt right up my alley: 1) it\u0026rsquo;s a desktop app, 2) it\u0026rsquo;s open-source, and 3) it\u0026rsquo;s written in my favorite coding language! Okay, I\u0026rsquo;m getting off track but the point is: I found the right tool.\nOnce I got the app installed, I probably spent a straight 12 hours just entering information and getting things to a presentable state.\n   Finding External Sources  I spent a few days on-and-off going between my documents and my DB, but it came to a point where I felt like I\u0026rsquo;d exhausted all internal sources. I kept trying to climb up my family tree but I eventually hit the canopy, so to speak. I had gained so much momentum and made so much progress that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to it stop\u0026hellip;but it did. I hit a wall for a few weeks and accepted that I would just continue when something came my way. I stopped working on my tree for about 2 months until I had this urge to revisit my sources, and I\u0026rsquo;m so glad I did. My next big leaps came in two parts.\nPart 1: stumbling upon the incredible work of Si√±ot Bernard Punzalan, particularly a PDF he created which contains Chamoru clan names. It was from this PDF that I was able to confirm some clan names that my parents had told me about. I figured, hey: I can probably find more info if I not only searched by my family names but my clan names as well, which ultimately led me to part two.\nPart 2: finding a set of great-grandparents for my grandma A via a blog written by P√•le' Eric. It was around this moment that I realized just how much info P√•le' Eric had on his blog. After spending more time reading on his site, I came across another blog which helped me (very likely) confirm my ancestry back 9 generations! Honestly though, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have second-guessed this blog if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t already spent some time in MyHeritage, because it was there that I discovered more people from my Aquiningoc/Taitano side.\nI have a feeling I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to get more info later on when I\u0026rsquo;m able to sub to Si√±ot Bernard\u0026rsquo;s Chamorro Roots Database, but for the time being I\u0026rsquo;ve slowed down on the tree.\n   My Tree Right Now  As of today, this is what my \u0026ldquo;family tree\u0026rdquo; (in fan-form) looks like right now.\nMy dad\u0026rsquo;s side: My mom\u0026rsquo;s side: As you can see, I was able to at least get all of my great-grandparents. I\u0026rsquo;m still missing a few great-great-grandparents, and honestly from there it\u0026rsquo;s scrambled. Truth be told, I\u0026rsquo;m incredibly surprised I was able to get as much info as I have! For now I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to focus on my uncles, aunts, and cousins. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to be able to create something that I can share at big family gatherings. I also plan on doing my wife\u0026rsquo;s side. Gi minag√•het, this is fun and relaxing for me.\nI think this seals it - I\u0026rsquo;m our self-proclaimed Family Historian üòé.\nTodu ha' para p√•\u0026rsquo;gu.

T√•ya'.\nI\u0026rsquo;m positive there\u0026rsquo;s complexities behind that. I mean, growing up I only ever heard one story about the war from my dad\u0026rsquo;s mom. It was a quick story, maybe 5 minutes in length, and it ended with her grasping one hand into the other, remembering the pain she felt as a young child from grabbing a freshly-ejected bullet casing that landed fi\u0026rsquo;on-√±a yan i che\u0026rsquo;lu-√±a as they hid gi papa' trongkon nunu.\nAs I write now, I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of how much history my grandparents didn\u0026rsquo;t pass down. Stories of their childhood, their upbringing, their families, their homes; stories I\u0026rsquo;ll likely never know. Estoria siha na ni ngai\u0026rsquo;an hu hunguk'.\nBut I get it, I really do.\nMy grandparents were 5-13 years old when this all happened, and it happened damn near in their front yards. The same soil that they walked to church on would become littered with imprints of combat boots in years to come. I try to imagine a boisterous chicken coop or two behind my grandpa\u0026rsquo;s house, but the imagined memory fades into silence\u0026hellip;and then into booms and explosions.\nWhy would my grandparents want to relive those memories? So I get it, I really do.\nAnd despite all that they had been through, when the time came both my grandpas turned to the U.S. Navy. Maybe they felt they owed it to the U.S. - for the \u0026ldquo;Liberation\u0026rdquo; they had received. I have no knowledge of how they came to those decisions, but they made them. And as I sit here in a comfy chair, in an air-conditioned house, where my parents can watch their grandchild respond to me as hu fino' Chamoruyi gui'\u0026hellip;ya si√±a ha komprendi yu'?\u0026hellip;well, I certainly can\u0026rsquo;t blame them - at least I don\u0026rsquo;t want to. They did what they thought was best.\nT√•ya' nai na hu silebra esti na ha\u0026rsquo;√•ni. Ya ti hu tungu' yanggen bai cho\u0026rsquo;gui' ennao. What I can and will do is give thanks to i manamko'-ta ni' manl√•\u0026rsquo;la' dur√•nten i gera. They were forced into an impossible situation and forced to make difficult decisions. Decisions with ramifications still echoing today.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ll end this not with an exclamation of joy, sa' para gu√•hu, ti minagof esti na ha\u0026rsquo;√•ni. Rather, it is a memorial day. A reminder of the courage and tenacity of our people. A reminder that we are still here, fighting for real liberation; for a decolonized status; for independence.\nFanohgi. Fanachu. Fanhassu.
