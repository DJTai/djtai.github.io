First things first: if you haven\u0026rsquo;t seen my first post re: my family tree then you can read it here.\nOkay, nihi ta tutuhun: I\u0026rsquo;ve been busy, dispensa yu'! I\u0026rsquo;ve been neck-deep in work and life in general, but I\u0026rsquo;m here now and I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share an update on my family tree! 🙌🏽 I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how much further I\u0026rsquo;d get honestly - I was doing so much research prior to December that I felt I\u0026rsquo;d found all the info that I could. Then I subscribed to https://www.chamorroroots.com/v7/, Siñot Punzalan\u0026rsquo;s geneaology website, and the excitement came rushing back! I was able to find 21 new people to add to my tree 😳! And while not as impressive a number, my aunt gave me some documents that gave me 4 more people, and also birth/death years for others who had that data missing 👏🏽. Needless to say: sen nina\u0026rsquo;magof yu' nu esti!\nNot much else to say but to give updates.\n   I Trongkun Manggafå-hu På\u0026#39;gu  Note: the colors represent their age at death, and it\u0026rsquo;s on a sort of gradient. The range is as follows:\n yellow = 25 years green = 50 years blue = 100 years  The outer white boxes mean I don\u0026rsquo;t have an age - I either don\u0026rsquo;t have a birthdate or a deathdate.\n   I Bandan Nanå-hu  If you compare this photo to the one in my other post, you\u0026rsquo;ll see I\u0026rsquo;ve added:\n Two greatx2 grandparents (on her mom\u0026rsquo;s side) Four greatx3 grandparents (two on her dad\u0026rsquo;s side, two on her mom\u0026rsquo;s) Two greatx4 grandparents (on her mom\u0026rsquo;s side)     I Bandan Tatå-hu  Compared to the photo of my dad\u0026rsquo;s side before, I\u0026rsquo;ve added:\n Two greatx2 grandparents (on his mom\u0026rsquo;s side) Eight greatx3 grandparents (four on his dad\u0026rsquo;s side, four on his mom\u0026rsquo;s) Six greatx4 grandparents (two on his dad\u0026rsquo;s side, four on his mom\u0026rsquo;s)     Pues Håfa På\u0026#39;gu?  For now I\u0026rsquo;ll try and start filling out the siblings I guess 😅? I spent most of my time only focused on the parents, grandparents, etc. Also, knowing that Siñot Punzalan\u0026rsquo;s database exist, it\u0026rsquo;d probably be best to start getting info on folks I know are not in his dataset, e.g., my cousins, my nieces and nephews, etc. Also, I have to start getting more info gi bandan asaguå-hu lokkui'!

I had to take a step back from dang near everything and reasses my priorities and how I spend my time outside of work - hence my absence 😅.\nBUT it was much needed as I\u0026rsquo;m here now and ready to share a bit about what I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on, which is: a personal Chamoru dictionary stored on my computer. This project was born out of three \u0026ldquo;issues\u0026rdquo; I kept running into:\n My favorite go-to resource for looking up Chamoru words (LearningChamoru.com) required too many steps* There were a lot of words I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find when searching Number 1 seems to only reflect the Guam Orthography, and I wanted something \u0026ldquo;more complete\u0026rdquo; (i.e., something with words spelled using the CNMI orthography)  * Too many steps = opening a browser, clicking login, logging in, scrolling down to \u0026ldquo;Dictionary\u0026rdquo;, and then searching for a word.\nPues, hu tutuhun i hinanao-hu. I created a template of what I thought a dictionary would look like on the back-end (in a database) and I started gathering as many words as I could find. Anytime I came across a new word, I\u0026rsquo;d pop open my database and add it in there. It took an egregious amount of time but I finally got to a place where I felt comfortable enough to start working on a \u0026ldquo;front-end\u0026rdquo; to access the database. I put that in quotes because in it\u0026rsquo;s current state I can only access it from a terminal/command-line interface (CLI). I started it off this way sa' gi minagåhet, it\u0026rsquo;s where I live when I code. Also it\u0026rsquo;s the fastest way I can access the database. Essentially I created a small program that allows me to access it via the CLI.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a screenshot of me running the program: If you\u0026rsquo;re unfamiliar with what you\u0026rsquo;re looking at, it\u0026rsquo;s a terminal/CLI. The points of interest are the second line, where you see └─ $ sodda, and then the text afterwards. My program runs when I type sodda and hit enter. I get prompted for a word to search for (in this case I entered \u0026quot; tungo' \u0026ldquo;), and then if it finds something I get results back. Otherwise it says it can\u0026rsquo;t find the word and the prompts just continue until I exit.\nCleaning the data and structuring how everything is stored/returned actually took the most amount of time. I wrote a lot of small helper programs to do things like sort the words, remove misformed words, and add new words, but I still have a lot of work ahead of me. There are still ~3000 words I have that I need to add but don\u0026rsquo;t have exact translations for. There are also a bunch of words I just straight up don\u0026rsquo;t have either.\nTo give you a sense of how big this dictionary has gotten, here is where I\u0026rsquo;m at: Currently I store everything in a JSON file, where each word will take up roughly ~20-25 lines. This is near the bottom of the file and as you can see it\u0026rsquo;s around 340,000 lines (last I checked, there were ~17,000 words). Some functionality is still missing like a) being able to give an English word and get a Chamoru word back, and b) giving suggestions/alternative spellings to what you provided.\nHinasso-ku na sen pairi esti!\u0026hellip;lao\u0026hellip;there\u0026rsquo;s one potential problem. I haven\u0026rsquo;t put this out there yet for everyone to see and try because I actually don\u0026rsquo;t know if I legally can 🤔.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t mentioned this yet, and perhaps you were able to pick it up from earlier when I mentioned why I created this tool, but\u0026hellip;I didn\u0026rsquo;t create a majority of this information from scratch. I made use of LearningChamoru.com, news articles from the GuamPDN, and any blog I could find that seemed like a great resource for filling up a dictionary. So for example, let\u0026rsquo;s say you use this tool and look up the word \u0026ldquo;magof\u0026rdquo; - one of the definitions you\u0026rsquo;d get back is the same one you\u0026rsquo;d find in LearningChamoru.com, word-for-word.\nPues hunggan, as much as I want to share this right now, there are still some things I need to figure out. Things like: if I put this dictionary out there, say on a website, would I receive a cease \u0026amp; desist? Could I get sued for copyright infringement? Would I be fine so long as I attribute my data to their correct creators? Etc\u0026hellip;\nNow that I think about it though\u0026hellip;the front-end stuff I can probably share. You\u0026rsquo;d of course need a dictionary stored in a same-structured JSON, but that general structure I can also share. But for now, this is all I\u0026rsquo;ll share. When I get more answers and more data and create something more accessible, I\u0026rsquo;ll give another update!\nTodu ha' para på\u0026rsquo;gu.

It started off simple: try and find out who my great-grandparents were. I honestly didn\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;d get past that because before this I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even tell you the names of any of my great-grandparents. But as you\u0026rsquo;ll soon find out, my simple task turned into a research-heavy adventure which is still ongoing.\nThis wasn\u0026rsquo;t on my to-do list until recently - I\u0026rsquo;d say within the last 2 years. I never really thought about any family past my grandparents; I never wondered who their parents or grandparents were. I also gave little thought to who their siblings were. I mean, growing up it just wasn\u0026rsquo;t something that they talked about. I want to say that I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know if they had had any siblings, although that became apparent closer to when I was in high school and started meeting extended family. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be until the passing of my grandmas that I would start to pay more attention. And it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be until just about 2 years ago that I would start digging into my family history.\n| Note: I\u0026rsquo;ll refer to my grandparents as Grandma/Grandpa A and Grandma/Grandpa T; Aquiningoc and Taitingfong respectively.\n   Gathering Documents  The first event that really triggered my search was receiving documents about my mom\u0026rsquo;s side of the family. My aunt had been holding onto them from when she was cleaning house, and I guess she just never thought that it would be of any excitement to us. I recall asking about family names - clan names in particular - and she went to her room to retrieve all the stuff she had. When she came back I was astounded: she had birth certificates, death certificates, legal documents, obituaries, funeral pamphlets, social security cards, and a lot more. The documents that piqued my interest were the ones about my grandma A\u0026rsquo;s siblings and some homemade lineage documents for my grandpa A\u0026rsquo;s side. I saw \u0026ldquo;Aquiningoc\u0026rdquo; on that paper but none of the names looked remotely familiar.\nLater that week I asked my dad what he knew about his parents. He told me not much but that he would ask his siblings what they knew. Within a few hours my dad had text me some scans: a photo of my grandpa T\u0026rsquo;s mom, a photo of my grandma T and her grandma, and a homemade lineage document detailing my grandma T\u0026rsquo;s family.\nThe two lineage documents were incredible finds. The one for my grandma T started with her grandparents. It listed their kids and all the grandchildren. My grandma was one of those grandchildren. Success: I found a set of great-grandparents!\nThe one for my grandpa A was even more interesting. It was laid out in a similar fashion: grandparents at the top, children below, and grandchildren below that. But my grandpa wasn\u0026rsquo;t on this list\u0026hellip;his dad wasn\u0026rsquo;t even on the list. I would come to find out that it was my grandpa A\u0026rsquo;s grandpa listed\u0026hellip;as a grandchild! So not only did I find another set of great-grandparents, but a set of their great-grandparents.\n I was so amazed yet at the same time a bit sad. These were people I never learned about and, gi minagåhet, likely never will. I made a decision right there to document everything I could; to create something that I can pass down to my children and to my siblings and cousins and aunts and todu i manggafå-hu.\nI started writing down names on paper but that got out of hand quickly. Thus started my search for a tool I could easily use and (hopefully) easily share.\n   Finding the Right Tool  They say the best time to start something was yesterday; the next best time is right now. With that in mind I figured I\u0026rsquo;d start with a spreadsheet-like program, so I started working in Google Sheets. It started off easy because I had only noted down my immediate family and my grandparents from both sides. When it came to writing down my uncles and aunts though I started to realize that wow: this is going to get out of hand quickly; my dad is 1 of 10, my mom is 1 of 6\u0026hellip;I don\u0026rsquo;t know about my grandparents, but I knew from the documents I had that their families were also \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo;.\nWhile continuing to work in Google Sheets I started to also look for alternatives because what started as a 3 sheet file grew into 16 sheets\u0026hellip;and that was just going up my family tree, i.e., I was only tracing parents and their parents and their parents and etc. I was able to track i mañainå-hu back 6 generations. Things started getting complicated and I needed a new tool.\n\nI temporarily used MyHeritage because it was convenient \u0026amp; had a decent amount of data I could use. There also were people there that had connections to some of my great- and great-great-grandparents, and to be honest that was pretty cool. But MyHeritage had it\u0026rsquo;s limitations: the desktop app was great, but it felt like most of the magic was happening on the web-side; also, most of the data that I needed to fill in the gaps in my tree were behind paywalls.\nSidebar: I much prefer desktop apps as opposed to web apps. From a business perspective, I understand why web apps are more ubiquitous\u0026hellip;but I tend to opt for desktop.\nI paused on entering new data and went to search for a different tool. That\u0026rsquo;s when I came across Gramps, an open-source genealogical research software - it\u0026rsquo;s essentially a database (DB) with a decent GUI. This felt right up my alley: 1) it\u0026rsquo;s a desktop app, 2) it\u0026rsquo;s open-source, and 3) it\u0026rsquo;s written in my favorite coding language! Okay, I\u0026rsquo;m getting off track but the point is: I found the right tool.\nOnce I got the app installed, I probably spent a straight 12 hours just entering information and getting things to a presentable state.\n   Finding External Sources  I spent a few days on-and-off going between my documents and my DB, but it came to a point where I felt like I\u0026rsquo;d exhausted all internal sources. I kept trying to climb up my family tree but I eventually hit the canopy, so to speak. I had gained so much momentum and made so much progress that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to it stop\u0026hellip;but it did. I hit a wall for a few weeks and accepted that I would just continue when something came my way. I stopped working on my tree for about 2 months until I had this urge to revisit my sources, and I\u0026rsquo;m so glad I did. My next big leaps came in two parts.\nPart 1: stumbling upon the incredible work of Siñot Bernard Punzalan, particularly a PDF he created which contains Chamoru clan names. It was from this PDF that I was able to confirm some clan names that my parents had told me about. I figured, hey: I can probably find more info if I not only searched by my family names but my clan names as well, which ultimately led me to part two.\nPart 2: finding a set of great-grandparents for my grandma A via a blog written by Påle' Eric. It was around this moment that I realized just how much info Påle' Eric had on his blog. After spending more time reading on his site, I came across another blog which helped me (very likely) confirm my ancestry back 9 generations! Honestly though, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have second-guessed this blog if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t already spent some time in MyHeritage, because it was there that I discovered more people from my Aquiningoc/Taitano side.\nI have a feeling I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to get more info later on when I\u0026rsquo;m able to sub to Siñot Bernard\u0026rsquo;s Chamorro Roots Database, but for the time being I\u0026rsquo;ve slowed down on the tree.\n   My Tree Right Now  As of today, this is what my \u0026ldquo;family tree\u0026rdquo; (in fan-form) looks like right now.\nMy dad\u0026rsquo;s side: My mom\u0026rsquo;s side: As you can see, I was able to at least get all of my great-grandparents. I\u0026rsquo;m still missing a few great-great-grandparents, and honestly from there it\u0026rsquo;s scrambled. Truth be told, I\u0026rsquo;m incredibly surprised I was able to get as much info as I have! For now I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to focus on my uncles, aunts, and cousins. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to be able to create something that I can share at big family gatherings. I also plan on doing my wife\u0026rsquo;s side. Gi minagåhet, this is fun and relaxing for me.\nI think this seals it - I\u0026rsquo;m our self-proclaimed Family Historian 😎.\nTodu ha' para på\u0026rsquo;gu.

Tåya'.\nI\u0026rsquo;m positive there\u0026rsquo;s complexities behind that. I mean, growing up I only ever heard one story about the war from my dad\u0026rsquo;s mom. It was a quick story, maybe 5 minutes in length, and it ended with her grasping one hand into the other, remembering the pain she felt as a young child from grabbing a freshly-ejected bullet casing that landed fi\u0026rsquo;on-ña yan i che\u0026rsquo;lu-ña as they hid gi papa' trongkon nunu.\nAs I write now, I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of how much history my grandparents didn\u0026rsquo;t pass down. Stories of their childhood, their upbringing, their families, their homes; stories I\u0026rsquo;ll likely never know. Estoria siha na ni ngai\u0026rsquo;an hu hunguk'.\nBut I get it, I really do.\nMy grandparents were 5-13 years old when this all happened, and it happened damn near in their front yards. The same soil that they walked to church on would become littered with imprints of combat boots in years to come. I try to imagine a boisterous chicken coop or two behind my grandpa\u0026rsquo;s house, but the imagined memory fades into silence\u0026hellip;and then into booms and explosions.\nWhy would my grandparents want to relive those memories? So I get it, I really do.\nAnd despite all that they had been through, when the time came both my grandpas turned to the U.S. Navy. Maybe they felt they owed it to the U.S. - for the \u0026ldquo;Liberation\u0026rdquo; they had received. I have no knowledge of how they came to those decisions, but they made them. And as I sit here in a comfy chair, in an air-conditioned house, where my parents can watch their grandchild respond to me as hu fino' Chamoruyi gui'\u0026hellip;ya siña ha komprendi yu'?\u0026hellip;well, I certainly can\u0026rsquo;t blame them - at least I don\u0026rsquo;t want to. They did what they thought was best.\nTåya' nai na hu silebra esti na ha\u0026rsquo;åni. Ya ti hu tungu' yanggen bai cho\u0026rsquo;gui' ennao. What I can and will do is give thanks to i manamko'-ta ni' manlå\u0026rsquo;la' durånten i gera. They were forced into an impossible situation and forced to make difficult decisions. Decisions with ramifications still echoing today.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ll end this not with an exclamation of joy, sa' para guåhu, ti minagof esti na ha\u0026rsquo;åni. Rather, it is a memorial day.
