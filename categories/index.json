[{"content":"TW/CW: Mentions of war.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t recall a time when my family celebrated \u0026ldquo;Liberation Day\u0026rdquo;.\nI can recall times that we volunteered at the Sons \u0026amp; Daughters of Guam Club for Liberation fiestas: cleaning, cooking, setting up \u0026amp; breaking down, etc\u0026hellip;but being young, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in the \u0026ldquo;whys\u0026rdquo; of fiestas.\nBut celebrating at home? Tåya'.\nI\u0026rsquo;m positive there\u0026rsquo;s complexities behind that. I mean, growing up I only ever heard one story about the war from my dad\u0026rsquo;s mom. It was a quick story, maybe 5 minutes in length, and it ended with her grasping one hand into the other, remembering the pain she felt as a young child from grabbing a freshly-ejected bullet casing that landed fi\u0026rsquo;on-ña yan i che\u0026rsquo;lu-ña as they hid gi papa' trongkon nunu.\nAs I write now, I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of how much history my grandparents didn\u0026rsquo;t pass down. Stories of their childhood, their upbringing, their families, their homes; stories I\u0026rsquo;ll likely never know. Estoria siha na ni ngai\u0026rsquo;an hu hunguk'.\nBut I get it, I really do.\nMy grandparents were 5-13 years old when this all happened, and it happened damn near in their front yards. The same soil that they walked to church on would become littered with imprints of combat boots in years to come. I try to imagine a boisterous chicken coop or two behind my grandpa\u0026rsquo;s house, but the imagined memory fades into silence\u0026hellip;and then into booms and explosions.\nWhy would my grandparents want to relive those memories? So I get it, I really do.\nAnd despite all that they had been through, when the time came both my grandpas turned to the U.S. Navy. Maybe they felt they owed it to the U.S. - for the \u0026ldquo;Liberation\u0026rdquo; they had received. I have no knowledge of how they came to those decisions, but they made them. And as I sit here in a comfy chair, in an air-conditioned house, where my parents can watch their grandchild respond to me as hu fino' Chamoruyi gui'\u0026hellip;ya siña ha komprendi yu'?\u0026hellip;well, I certainly can\u0026rsquo;t blame them - at least I don\u0026rsquo;t want to. They did what they thought was best.\nTåya' nai na hu silebra esti na ha\u0026rsquo;åni. Ya ti hu tungu' yanggen bai cho\u0026rsquo;gui' ennao. What I can and will do is give thanks to i manamko'-ta ni' manlå\u0026rsquo;la' durånten i gera. They were forced into an impossible situation and forced to make difficult decisions. Decisions with ramifications still echoing today.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ll end this not with an exclamation of joy, sa' para guåhu, ti minagof esti na ha\u0026rsquo;åni. Rather, it is a memorial day. A reminder of the courage and tenacity of our people. A reminder that we are still here, fighting for real liberation; for a decolonized status; for independence.\nFanohgi. Fanachu.

DJT.\nEnglish Translation The 1st blog is here.\nHello everyone! It\u0026rsquo;s been a long time since I\u0026rsquo;ve written here, yeah? Honestly, I\u0026rsquo;ve been really busy these past two months. Every day, I do what I typically do: wake up and exercise or eat, then I work, and then I play with my son. It all drains me, lol.\nThe reason for this blog is so that I can share more simple phrases I tell my son.\nIf there are mistakes in this blog, then tell me please \u0026mdash; I\u0026rsquo;m still a student and learning every day.\nPhrases I Tell My Son ⬆ go back up to read the phrases 😁\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it for now.\nAll love.

But as they say: there\u0026rsquo;s no better time than the present\u0026hellip;so here we are!\nThis blog will largely represent my journey in learning the Chamoru language. I\u0026rsquo;m going to try and utilize tags and categories as much as possible to keep things organized, but you can expect to see writings of all forms: lessons, poems, sporadic thoughts, etc.\nBear in mind that I still consider myself a beginner in this space (particularly when it comes to conversing) so if you read something and think, \u0026ldquo;Ai adai, milachi gi tinigi'-mu\u0026rdquo;, then cut me some slack pot fabot. Ya hunggan, siña ha' para un li\u0026rsquo;i' bula na ini, i.e., I\u0026rsquo;ll be switching from English to Chamoru and vice versa. My goal is to use as much Chamoru as possible but ai adai, guaha na biåhi na siña makkat ennao, lao bai hu chagi.\nHopefully you find my writings interesting. Hopefully this journey never ends and we find our paths crossing at some point. Todu ha' para på\u0026rsquo;gu.

Guahu si David Taitingfong \u0026mdash; welcome to my blog! If you\u0026rsquo;re curious about why I started this blog, the tl;dr version is:\n I\u0026rsquo;m using this space to document and combine my passions for 1) teaching, 2) tech, \u0026amp; 3) my heritage.\n Let me break that down for you real quick.\n I thoroughly enjoy teaching people things, and so I hope to one day be considered an educator/teacher. I consider myself a tech-nerd, and enjoy all aspects whether it be hardware or software. It took me a long time to really appreciate my culture, and an even longer time to start learning the language, i Fino' Chamoru.  This blog is my attempt to document my journey, i hinanao-hu, in continuing to advance those 3 passions while simulatenously intersecting and/or combining them. Some blogs may be me teaching you Chamoru phrases; some blogs may be about tech but written in Chamoru; hopefully more of my blogs will combine all 3 in some way or another.\nIn any case, I thank you for visting and potentialy embarking with me gi hinanao-hu (on my journey).\nSaina Ma\u0026rsquo;åsi' yan nå\u0026rsquo;fansåfu (Thank you and be safe)\nContact Me You can reach me via various mediums, all of which are linked below in the icons.\n","description":"","id":15,"section":"","tags":null,"title":"$ whoami","uri":"https://djtai.github.io/about/"}]
