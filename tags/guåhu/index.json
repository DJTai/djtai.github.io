[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been on a journey to document my family tree in a tech-saavy way. It started off simple: try and find out who my great-grandparents were. I honestly didn\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;d get past that because before this I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even tell you the names of any of my great-grandparents. But as you\u0026rsquo;ll soon find out, my simple task turned into a research-heavy adventure which is still ongoing.\nThis wasn\u0026rsquo;t on my to-do list until recently - I\u0026rsquo;d say within the last 2 years. I never really thought about any family past my grandparents; I never wondered who their parents or grandparents were. I also gave little thought to who their siblings were. I mean, growing up it just wasn\u0026rsquo;t something that they talked about. I want to say that I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know if they had had any siblings, although that became apparent closer to when I was in high school and started meeting extended family. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be until the passing of my grandmas that I would start to pay more attention. And it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be until just about 2 years ago that I would start digging into my family history.\n| Note: I\u0026rsquo;ll refer to my grandparents as Grandma/Grandpa A and Grandma/Grandpa T; Aquiningoc and Taitingfong respectively.\nGathering Documents The first event that really triggered my search was receiving documents about my mom\u0026rsquo;s side of the family. My aunt had been holding onto them from when she was cleaning house, and I guess she just never thought that it would be of any excitement to us. I recall asking about family names - clan names in particular - and she went to her room to retrieve all the stuff she had. When she came back I was astounded: she had birth certificates, death certificates, legal documents, obituaries, funeral pamphlets, social security cards, and a lot more. The documents that piqued my interest were the ones about my grandma A\u0026rsquo;s siblings and some homemade lineage documents for my grandpa A\u0026rsquo;s side. I saw \u0026ldquo;Aquiningoc\u0026rdquo; on that paper but none of the names looked remotely familiar.\nLater that week I asked my dad what he knew about his parents. He told me not much but that he would ask his siblings what they knew. Within a few hours my dad had text me some scans: a photo of my grandpa T\u0026rsquo;s mom, a photo of my grandma T and her grandma, and a homemade lineage document detailing my grandma T\u0026rsquo;s family.\nThe two lineage documents were incredible finds. The one for my grandma T started with her grandparents. It listed their kids and all the grandchildren. My grandma was one of those grandchildren. Success: I found a set of great-grandparents!\nThe one for my grandpa A was even more interesting. It was laid out in a similar fashion: grandparents at the top, children below, and grandchildren below that. But my grandpa wasn\u0026rsquo;t on this list\u0026hellip;his dad wasn\u0026rsquo;t even on the list. I would come to find out that it was my grandpa A\u0026rsquo;s grandpa listed\u0026hellip;as a grandchild! So not only did I find another set of great-grandparents, but a set of their great-grandparents.\n I was so amazed yet at the same time a bit sad. These were people I never learned about and, gi minagåhet, likely never will. I made a decision right there to document everything I could; to create something that I can pass down to my children and to my siblings and cousins and aunts and todu i manggafå-hu.\nI started writing down names on paper but that got out of hand quickly. Thus started my search for a tool I could easily use and (hopefully) easily share.\nFinding the Right Tool They say the best time to start something was yesterday; the next best time is right now. With that in mind I figured I\u0026rsquo;d start with a spreadsheet-like program, so I started working in Google Sheets. It started off easy because I had only noted down my immediate family and my grandparents from both sides. When it came to writing down my uncles and aunts though I started to realize that wow: this is going to get out of hand quickly; my dad is 1 of 10, my mom is 1 of 6\u0026hellip;I don\u0026rsquo;t know about my grandparents, but I knew from the documents I had that their families were also \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo;.\nWhile continuing to work in Google Sheets I started to also look for alternatives because what started as a 3 sheet file grew into 16 sheets\u0026hellip;and that was just going up my family tree, i.e., I was only tracing parents and their parents and their parents and etc. I was able to track i mañainå-hu back 6 generations. Things started getting complicated and I needed a new tool.\n\nI temporarily used MyHeritage because it was convenient \u0026amp; had a decent amount of data I could use. There also were people there that had connections to some of my great- and great-great-grandparents, and to be honest that was pretty cool. But MyHeritage had it\u0026rsquo;s limitations: the desktop app was great, but it felt like most of the magic was happening on the web-side; also, most of the data that I needed to fill in the gaps in my tree were behind paywalls.\nSidebar: I much prefer desktop apps as opposed to web apps. From a business perspective, I understand why web apps are more ubiquitous\u0026hellip;but I tend to opt for desktop.\nI paused on entering new data and went to search for a different tool. That\u0026rsquo;s when I came across Gramps, an open-source genealogical research software - it\u0026rsquo;s essentially a database (DB) with a decent GUI. This felt right up my alley: 1) it\u0026rsquo;s a desktop app, 2) it\u0026rsquo;s open-source, and 3) it\u0026rsquo;s written in my favorite coding language! Okay, I\u0026rsquo;m getting off track but the point is: I found the right tool.\nOnce I got the app installed, I probably spent a straight 12 hours just entering information and getting things to a presentable state.\nFinding External Sources I spent a few days on-and-off going between my documents and my DB, but it came to a point where I felt like I\u0026rsquo;d exhausted all internal sources. I kept trying to climb up my family tree but I eventually hit the canopy, so to speak. I had gained so much momentum and made so much progress that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to it stop\u0026hellip;but it did. I hit a wall for a few weeks and accepted that I would just continue when something came my way. I stopped working on my tree for about 2 months until I had this urge to revisit my sources, and I\u0026rsquo;m so glad I did. My next big leaps came in two parts.\nPart 1: stumbling upon the incredible work of Siñot Bernard Punzalan, particularly a PDF he created which contains Chamoru clan names. It was from this PDF that I was able to confirm some clan names that my parents had told me about. I figured, hey: I can probably find more info if I not only searched by my family names but my clan names as well, which ultimately led me to part two.\nPart 2: finding a set of great-grandparents for my grandma A via a blog written by Påle' Eric. It was around this moment that I realized just how much info Påle' Eric had on his blog. After spending more time reading on his site, I came across another blog which helped me (very likely) confirm my ancestry back 9 generations! Honestly though, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have second-guessed this blog if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t already spent some time in MyHeritage, because it was there that I discovered more people from my Aquiningoc/Taitano side.\nI have a feeling I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to get more info later on when I\u0026rsquo;m able to sub to Siñot Bernard\u0026rsquo;s Chamorro Roots Database, but for the time being I\u0026rsquo;ve slowed down on the tree.\nMy Tree Right Now As of today, this is what my \u0026ldquo;family tree\u0026rdquo; (in fan-form) looks like right now.\nMy dad\u0026rsquo;s side: My mom\u0026rsquo;s side: As you can see, I was able to at least get all of my great-grandparents. I\u0026rsquo;m still missing a few great-great-grandparents, and honestly from there it\u0026rsquo;s scrambled. Truth be told, I\u0026rsquo;m incredibly surprised I was able to get as much info as I have! For now I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to focus on my uncles, aunts, and cousins. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to be able to create something that I can share at big family gatherings. I also plan on doing my wife\u0026rsquo;s side. Gi minagåhet, this is fun and relaxing for me.\nI think this seals it - I\u0026rsquo;m our self-proclaimed Family Historian 😎.\nTodu ha' para på\u0026rsquo;gu.

Tåya'.\nI\u0026rsquo;m positive there\u0026rsquo;s complexities behind that. I mean, growing up I only ever heard one story about the war from my dad\u0026rsquo;s mom. It was a quick story, maybe 5 minutes in length, and it ended with her grasping one hand into the other, remembering the pain she felt as a young child from grabbing a freshly-ejected bullet casing that landed fi\u0026rsquo;on-ña yan i che\u0026rsquo;lu-ña as they hid gi papa' trongkon nunu.\nAs I write now, I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of how much history my grandparents didn\u0026rsquo;t pass down. Stories of their childhood, their upbringing, their families, their homes; stories I\u0026rsquo;ll likely never know. Estoria siha na ni ngai\u0026rsquo;an hu hunguk'.\nBut I get it, I really do.\nMy grandparents were 5-13 years old when this all happened, and it happened damn near in their front yards. The same soil that they walked to church on would become littered with imprints of combat boots in years to come. I try to imagine a boisterous chicken coop or two behind my grandpa\u0026rsquo;s house, but the imagined memory fades into silence\u0026hellip;and then into booms and explosions.\nWhy would my grandparents want to relive those memories? So I get it, I really do.\nAnd despite all that they had been through, when the time came both my grandpas turned to the U.S. Navy. Maybe they felt they owed it to the U.S. - for the \u0026ldquo;Liberation\u0026rdquo; they had received. I have no knowledge of how they came to those decisions, but they made them. And as I sit here in a comfy chair, in an air-conditioned house, where my parents can watch their grandchild respond to me as hu fino' Chamoruyi gui'\u0026hellip;ya siña ha komprendi yu'?\u0026hellip;well, I certainly can\u0026rsquo;t blame them - at least I don\u0026rsquo;t want to. They did what they thought was best.\nTåya' nai na hu silebra esti na ha\u0026rsquo;åni. Ya ti hu tungu' yanggen bai cho\u0026rsquo;gui' ennao. What I can and will do is give thanks to i manamko'-ta ni' manlå\u0026rsquo;la' durånten i gera. They were forced into an impossible situation and forced to make difficult decisions. Decisions with ramifications still echoing today.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ll end this not with an exclamation of joy, sa' para guåhu, ti minagof esti na ha\u0026rsquo;åni. Rather, it is a memorial day. A reminder of the courage and tenacity of our people. A reminder that we are still here, fighting for real liberation; for a decolonized status; for independence.\nFanohgi. Fanachu. Fanhassu.

I consider myself a tech-nerd, and enjoy all aspects whether it be hardware or software. It took me a long time to truly appreciate my culture, and an even longer time to start learning the language.  This blog is my attempt to document my journey, i hinanao-hu, in continuing to advance those 3 passions while simulatenously intersecting and/or combining them. Some blogs may be me teaching you Chamoru phrases; some blogs may be about tech but written in Chamoru; hopefully more of my blogs will combine all 3 in some way or another.\nIn any case, I thank you for visting and potentialy embarking with me gi hinanao-hu (on my journey).\nSaina Ma\u0026rsquo;åsi' yan na\u0026rsquo;fansåfu (Thank you and be safe)\nContact Me You can reach me via various mediums, all of which are linked below in the icons.\n","description":"","id":16,"section":"","tags":null,"title":"$ whoami","uri":"https://djtai.github.io/about/"}]
