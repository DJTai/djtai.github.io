            <p>I&rsquo;ve been on a journey to document my family tree in a tech-saavy way. It started off simple: try and find out who my great-grandparents were. I honestly didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d get past that because before this I couldn&rsquo;t even tell you the names of any of my great-grandparents. But as you&rsquo;ll soon find out, my simple task turned into a research-heavy adventure which is still ongoing.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t on my to-do list until recently - I&rsquo;d say within the last 2 years. I never really thought about any family past my grandparents; I never wondered who their parents or grandparents were. I also gave little thought to who their siblings were. I mean, growing up it just wasn&rsquo;t something that they talked about. I want to say that I didn&rsquo;t even know if they had <em>had</em> any siblings, although that became apparent closer to when I was in high school and started meeting extended family. It wouldn&rsquo;t be until the passing of my grandmas that I would start to pay more attention. And it wouldn&rsquo;t be until just about 2 years ago that I would start digging into my family history.</p>
<p>| <strong>Note</strong>: I&rsquo;ll refer to my grandparents as Grandma/Grandpa A and Grandma/Grandpa T; Aquiningoc and Taitingfong respectively.</p>

    Gathering Documents
</h2>
<p>The first event that really triggered my search was receiving documents about my mom&rsquo;s side of the family. My aunt had been holding onto them from when she was cleaning house, and I guess she just never thought that it would be of any excitement to us. I recall asking about family names - clan names in particular - and she went to her room to retrieve all the stuff she had. When she came back I was astounded: she had birth certificates, death certificates, legal documents, obituaries, funeral pamphlets, social security cards, and a lot more. The documents that piqued my interest were the ones about my grandma A&rsquo;s siblings and some homemade lineage documents for my grandpa A&rsquo;s side. I saw &ldquo;Aquiningoc&rdquo; on that paper but none of the names looked remotely familiar.</p>
<p>Later that week I asked my dad what he knew about his parents. He told me not much but that he would ask his siblings what they knew. Within a few hours my dad had text me some scans: a photo of my grandpa T&rsquo;s mom, a photo of my grandma T and <em>her</em> grandma, and a homemade lineage document detailing my grandma T&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>The two lineage documents were incredible finds. The one for my grandma T started with <em>her</em> grandparents. It listed <em>their</em> kids and all the grandchildren. My grandma was one of those grandchildren. Success: I found a set of great-grandparents!</p>
<p>The one for my grandpa A was even more interesting. It was laid out in a similar fashion: grandparents at the top, children below, and grandchildren below that. But my grandpa wasn&rsquo;t on this list&hellip;his dad wasn&rsquo;t even on the list. I would come to find out that it was my grandpa A&rsquo;s grandpa listed&hellip;as a grandchild! So not only did I find another set of great-grandparents, but a set of <em>their</em> great-grandparents.</p>

<p>I was so amazed yet at the same time a bit sad. These were people I never learned about and, <em>gi minagåhet</em>, likely never will. I made a decision right there to document everything I could; to create something that I can pass down to my children and to my siblings and cousins and aunts and <em>todu i manggafå-hu</em>.</p>
<p>I started writing down names on paper but that got out of hand quickly. Thus started my search for a tool I could easily use and (hopefully) easily share.</p>

    Finding the Right Tool
</h2>
<p>They say the best time to start something was yesterday; the next best time is right now. With that in mind I figured I&rsquo;d start with a spreadsheet-like program, so I started working in Google Sheets. It started off easy because I had only noted down my immediate family and my grandparents from both sides. When it came to writing down my uncles and aunts though I started to realize that wow: this is going to get out of hand quickly; my dad is 1 of 10, my mom is 1 of 6&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know about my grandparents, but I knew from the documents I had that their families were also &ldquo;big&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While continuing to work in Google Sheets I started to also look for alternatives because what started as a 3 sheet file grew into 16 sheets&hellip;and that was just going <strong>up</strong> my family tree, i.e., I was only tracing parents and their parents and their parents and etc. I was able to track <em>i mañainå-hu</em> back 6 generations. Things started getting complicated and I needed a new tool.</p>
<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:42%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/Go19CKEFdS6JvnPVP3" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/thefastsaga-fast-and-furious-saga-fate-of-the-Go19CKEFdS6JvnPVP3"></a></p>
<p>I temporarily used MyHeritage because it was convenient &amp; had a decent amount of data I could use. There also were people there that had connections to some of my great- and great-great-grandparents, and to be honest that was pretty cool. But MyHeritage had it&rsquo;s limitations: the desktop app was great, but it felt like most of the magic was happening on the web-side; also, most of the data that I needed to fill in the gaps in my tree were behind paywalls.</p>
<p><strong>Sidebar:</strong> I much prefer desktop apps as opposed to web apps. From a business perspective, I understand why web apps are more ubiquitous&hellip;but I tend to opt for desktop.</p>
<p>I paused on entering new data and went to search for a different tool. That&rsquo;s when I came across <a href="https://gramps-project.org/blog/">Gramps</a>, an open-source genealogical research software - it&rsquo;s essentially a database (DB) with a decent GUI. This felt right up my alley: 1) it&rsquo;s a desktop app, 2) it&rsquo;s open-source, and 3) it&rsquo;s written in <a href="https://www.python.org/">my favorite coding language</a>! Okay, I&rsquo;m getting off track but the point is: I found the right tool.</p>
<p>Once I got the app installed, I probably spent a straight 12 hours just entering information and getting things to a presentable state.</p>

    Finding External Sources
</h2>
<p>I spent a few days on-and-off going between my documents and my DB, but it came to a point where I felt like I&rsquo;d exhausted all internal sources. I kept trying to climb up my family tree but I eventually hit the canopy, so to speak. I had gained so much momentum and made so much progress that I didn&rsquo;t want to it stop&hellip;but it did. I hit a wall for a few weeks and accepted that I would just continue when something came my way. I stopped working on my tree for about 2 months until I had this urge to revisit my sources, and I&rsquo;m so glad I did. My next big leaps came in two parts.</p>
<p>Part 1: stumbling upon the incredible work of <a href="https://chamorroroots.com/v7/">Siñot Bernard Punzalan</a>, particularly a PDF he created <a href="https://www.academia.edu/36201434/I_N%C3%85AN_MANGG%C3%85FAN_TAOTAO_H%C3%85YA_CHAMORRO_FAMILY_CLAN_NAMES">which contains Chamoru clan names</a>. It was from this PDF that I was able to confirm some clan names that my parents had told me about. I figured, hey: I can probably find more info if I not only searched by my family names but my <strong>clan names</strong> as well, which ultimately led me to part two.</p>
<p>Part 2: finding a set of great-grandparents for <em>my</em> grandma A via a blog written by <a href="https://paleric.blogspot.com/2013/01/family-nicknames-gutos.html">Påle' Eric</a>. It was around this moment that I realized just how much info Påle' Eric had on his blog. After spending more time reading on his site, I came across <a href="https://paleric.blogspot.com/2015/06/whaling-contract-of-josen-kueto.html">another blog</a> which helped me (very likely) confirm my ancestry back 9 generations! Honestly though, I wouldn&rsquo;t have second-guessed this blog if I hadn&rsquo;t already spent some time in MyHeritage, because it was there that I discovered more people from my <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/research?action=query&amp;formId=master&amp;formMode=1&amp;qname=Name+fn.Maria%2F3nicolasa+fnmo.2+fnmsvos.1+fnmsmi.1+ln.Manahane+lnmo.4+lnmsdm.1+lnmsmf3.1+lnmsrs.1">Aquiningoc/Taitano side</a>.</p>
<p>I have a feeling I&rsquo;ll be able to get more info later on when I&rsquo;m able to sub to Siñot Bernard&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.chamorroroots.com/v7/index.php/the-store/subscription-plans-available/subscribe?group_id=5">Chamorro Roots Database</a>, but for the time being I&rsquo;ve slowed down on the tree.</p>

    My Tree Right Now
</h2>
<p>As of today, this is what my &ldquo;family tree&rdquo; (in fan-form) looks like right now.</p>

<p>As you can see, I was able to at least get all of my great-grandparents. I&rsquo;m still missing a few great-great-grandparents, and honestly from there it&rsquo;s scrambled. Truth be told, I&rsquo;m incredibly surprised I was able to get as much info as I have! For now I think I&rsquo;m going to focus on my uncles, aunts, and cousins. I&rsquo;m hoping to be able to create something that I can share at big family gatherings. I also plan on doing my wife&rsquo;s side. <em>Gi minagåhet</em>, this is fun and relaxing for me.</p>
<p>I think this seals it - I&rsquo;m our self-proclaimed Family Historian 😎.</p>
<p>Todu ha' para på&rsquo;gu. Bula guinaiya! &mdash; DJT.</p>
