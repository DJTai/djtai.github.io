        <description>I&#39;ve been on a journey to document my family tree in a tech-saavy way.</description>
        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a journey to document my family tree in a tech-saavy way. It started off simple: try and find out who my great-grandparents were. I honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d get past that because before this I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even tell you the names of any of my great-grandparents. But as you&amp;rsquo;ll soon find out, my simple task turned into a research-heavy adventure which is still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn&amp;rsquo;t on my to-do list until recently - I&amp;rsquo;d say within the last 2 years. I never really thought about any family past my grandparents; I never wondered who their parents or grandparents were. I also gave little thought to who their siblings were. I mean, growing up it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t something that they talked about. I want to say that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know if they had &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; any siblings, although that became apparent closer to when I was in high school and started meeting extended family. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be until the passing of my grandmas that I would start to pay more attention. And it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be until just about 2 years ago that I would start digging into my family history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to my grandparents as Grandma/Grandpa A and Grandma/Grandpa T; Aquiningoc and Taitingfong respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gathering-documents&#34;&gt;Gathering Documents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first event that really triggered my search was receiving documents about my mom&amp;rsquo;s side of the family. My aunt had been holding onto them from when she was cleaning house, and I guess she just never thought that it would be of any excitement to us. I recall asking about family names - clan names in particular - and she went to her room to retrieve all the stuff she had. When she came back I was astounded: she had birth certificates, death certificates, legal documents, obituaries, funeral pamphlets, social security cards, and a lot more. The documents that piqued my interest were the ones about my grandma A&amp;rsquo;s siblings and some homemade lineage documents for my grandpa A&amp;rsquo;s side. I saw &amp;ldquo;Aquiningoc&amp;rdquo; on that paper but none of the names looked remotely familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that week I asked my dad what he knew about his parents. He told me not much but that he would ask his siblings what they knew. Within a few hours my dad had text me some scans: a photo of my grandpa T&amp;rsquo;s mom, a photo of my grandma T and &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; grandma, and a homemade lineage document detailing my grandma T&amp;rsquo;s family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two lineage documents were incredible finds. The one for my grandma T started with &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; grandparents. It listed &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; kids and all the grandchildren. My grandma was one of those grandchildren. Success: I found a set of great-grandparents!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one for my grandpa A was even more interesting. It was laid out in a similar fashion: grandparents at the top, children below, and grandchildren below that. But my grandpa wasn&amp;rsquo;t on this list&amp;hellip;his dad wasn&amp;rsquo;t even on the list. I would come to find out that it was my grandpa A&amp;rsquo;s grandpa listed&amp;hellip;as a grandchild! So not only did I find another set of great-grandparents, but a set of &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; great-grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;width:80%&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;height:0;padding-bottom:56.111111111111114%;position:relative;width:100%&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/KuKm4I6OjNwoZ68np7/video&#34; style=&#34;left:0;position:absolute;top:0&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so amazed yet at the same time a bit sad. These were people I never learned about and, &lt;em&gt;gi minagåhet&lt;/em&gt;, likely never will. I made a decision right there to document everything I could; to create something that I can pass down to my children and to my siblings and cousins and aunts and &lt;em&gt;todu i manggafå-hu&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started writing down names on paper but that got out of hand quickly. Thus started my search for a tool I could easily use and (hopefully) easily share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-the-right-tool&#34;&gt;Finding the Right Tool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say the best time to start something was yesterday; the next best time is right now. With that in mind I figured I&amp;rsquo;d start with a spreadsheet-like program, so I started working in Google Sheets. It started off easy because I had only noted down my immediate family and my grandparents from both sides. When it came to writing down my uncles and aunts though I started to realize that wow: this is going to get out of hand quickly; my dad is 1 of 10, my mom is 1 of 6&amp;hellip;I don&amp;rsquo;t know about my grandparents, but I knew from the documents I had that their families were also &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While continuing to work in Google Sheets I started to also look for alternatives because what started as a 3 sheet file grew into 16 sheets&amp;hellip;and that was just going &lt;strong&gt;up&lt;/strong&gt; my family tree, i.e., I was only tracing parents and their parents and their parents and etc. I was able to track &lt;em&gt;i mañainå-hu&lt;/em&gt; back 6 generations. Things started getting complicated and I needed a new tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:42%;position:relative;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/Go19CKEFdS6JvnPVP3&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; style=&#34;position:absolute&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;giphy-embed&#34; allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://giphy.com/gifs/thefastsaga-fast-and-furious-saga-fate-of-the-Go19CKEFdS6JvnPVP3&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I temporarily used MyHeritage because it was convenient &amp;amp; had a decent amount of data I could use. There also were people there that had connections to some of my great- and great-great-grandparents, and to be honest that was pretty cool. But MyHeritage had it&amp;rsquo;s limitations: the desktop app was great, but it felt like most of the magic was happening on the web-side; also, most of the data that I needed to fill in the gaps in my tree were behind paywalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidebar:&lt;/strong&gt; I much prefer desktop apps as opposed to web apps. From a business perspective, I understand why web apps are more ubiquitous&amp;hellip;but I tend to opt for desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I paused on entering new data and went to search for a different tool. That&amp;rsquo;s when I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://gramps-project.org/blog/&#34;&gt;Gramps&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source genealogical research software - it&amp;rsquo;s essentially a database (DB) with a decent GUI. This felt right up my alley: 1) it&amp;rsquo;s a desktop app, 2) it&amp;rsquo;s open-source, and 3) it&amp;rsquo;s written in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/&#34;&gt;my favorite coding language&lt;/a&gt;! Okay, I&amp;rsquo;m getting off track but the point is: I found the right tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got the app installed, I probably spent a straight 12 hours just entering information and getting things to a presentable state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-external-sources&#34;&gt;Finding External Sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a few days on-and-off going between my documents and my DB, but it came to a point where I felt like I&amp;rsquo;d exhausted all internal sources. I kept trying to climb up my family tree but I eventually hit the canopy, so to speak. I had gained so much momentum and made so much progress that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to it stop&amp;hellip;but it did. I hit a wall for a few weeks and accepted that I would just continue when something came my way. I stopped working on my tree for about 2 months until I had this urge to revisit my sources, and I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I did. My next big leaps came in two parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 1: stumbling upon the incredible work of &lt;a href=&#34;https://chamorroroots.com/v7/&#34;&gt;Siñot Bernard Punzalan&lt;/a&gt;, particularly a PDF he created &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.academia.edu/36201434/I_N%C3%85AN_MANGG%C3%85FAN_TAOTAO_H%C3%85YA_CHAMORRO_FAMILY_CLAN_NAMES&#34;&gt;which contains Chamoru clan names&lt;/a&gt;. It was from this PDF that I was able to confirm some clan names that my parents had told me about. I figured, hey: I can probably find more info if I not only searched by my family names but my &lt;strong&gt;clan names&lt;/strong&gt; as well, which ultimately led me to part two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 2: finding a set of great-grandparents for &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; grandma A via a blog written by &lt;a href=&#34;https://paleric.blogspot.com/2013/01/family-nicknames-gutos.html&#34;&gt;Påle&#39; Eric&lt;/a&gt;. It was around this moment that I realized just how much info Påle&#39; Eric had on his blog. After spending more time reading on his site, I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://paleric.blogspot.com/2015/06/whaling-contract-of-josen-kueto.html&#34;&gt;another blog&lt;/a&gt; which helped me (very likely) confirm my ancestry back 9 generations! Honestly though, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have second-guessed this blog if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t already spent some time in MyHeritage, because it was there that I discovered more people from my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.myheritage.com/research?action=query&amp;amp;formId=master&amp;amp;formMode=1&amp;amp;qname=Name+fn.Maria%2F3nicolasa+fnmo.2+fnmsvos.1+fnmsmi.1+ln.Manahane+lnmo.4+lnmsdm.1+lnmsmf3.1+lnmsrs.1&#34;&gt;Aquiningoc/Taitano side&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a feeling I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to get more info later on when I&amp;rsquo;m able to sub to Siñot Bernard&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chamorroroots.com/v7/index.php/the-store/subscription-plans-available/subscribe?group_id=5&#34;&gt;Chamorro Roots Database&lt;/a&gt;, but for the time being I&amp;rsquo;ve slowed down on the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-tree-right-now&#34;&gt;My Tree Right Now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, this is what my &amp;ldquo;family tree&amp;rdquo; (in fan-form) looks like right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad&amp;rsquo;s side: &lt;img src=&#34;https://djtai.github.io/images/2021-08-11_CastroTaitingfong.png&#34; alt=&#34;Fan chart showing my dad&amp;rsquo;s side of my family tree&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom&amp;rsquo;s side: &lt;img src=&#34;https://djtai.github.io/images/2021-08-11_MendiolaAquiningoc.png&#34; alt=&#34;Half-fan chart showing my mom&amp;rsquo;s side of my family tree&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I was able to at least get all of my great-grandparents. I&amp;rsquo;m still missing a few great-great-grandparents, and honestly from there it&amp;rsquo;s scrambled. Truth be told, I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly surprised I was able to get as much info as I have! For now I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on my uncles, aunts, and cousins. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to be able to create something that I can share at big family gatherings. I also plan on doing my wife&amp;rsquo;s side. &lt;em&gt;Gi minagåhet&lt;/em&gt;, this is fun and relaxing for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this seals it - I&amp;rsquo;m our self-proclaimed Family Historian 😎.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todu ha&#39; para på&amp;rsquo;gu. Bula guinaiya! &amp;mdash; DJT.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Sharing my thoughts on this important day in Chamoru history.</description>
        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TW/CW:&lt;/strong&gt; Mentions of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t recall a time when my family celebrated &amp;ldquo;Liberation Day&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; recall times that we volunteered at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.guamclub.org/&#34;&gt;Sons &amp;amp; Daughters of Guam Club&lt;/a&gt; for Liberation fiestas: cleaning, cooking, setting up &amp;amp; breaking down, etc&amp;hellip;but being young, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested in the &amp;ldquo;whys&amp;rdquo; of fiestas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But celebrating at home? &lt;em&gt;Tåya&#39;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m positive there&amp;rsquo;s complexities behind that. I mean, growing up I only ever heard &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; story about the war from my dad&amp;rsquo;s mom. It was a quick story, maybe 5 minutes in length, and it ended with her grasping one hand into the other, remembering the pain she felt as a young child from grabbing a freshly-ejected bullet casing that landed &lt;em&gt;fi&amp;rsquo;on-ña yan i che&amp;rsquo;lu-ña&lt;/em&gt; as they hid &lt;em&gt;gi papa&#39; trongkon nunu&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write now, I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of how much history my grandparents didn&amp;rsquo;t pass down. Stories of their childhood, their upbringing, their families, their homes; stories I&amp;rsquo;ll likely never know. &lt;em&gt;Estoria siha na ni ngai&amp;rsquo;an hu hunguk&#39;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I get it, I really do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandparents were 5-13 years old when this all happened, and it happened damn near in their front yards. The same soil that they walked to church on would become littered with imprints of combat boots in years to come. I try to imagine a boisterous chicken coop or two behind my grandpa&amp;rsquo;s house, but the imagined memory fades into silence&amp;hellip;and then into booms and explosions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would my grandparents want to relive those memories? So I get it, I really do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And despite all that they had been through, when the time came both my grandpas turned to the U.S. Navy. Maybe they felt they owed it to the U.S. - for the &amp;ldquo;Liberation&amp;rdquo; they had received. I have no knowledge of how they came to those decisions, but they made them. And as I sit here in a comfy chair, in an air-conditioned house, where my parents can watch their grandchild respond to me as &lt;em&gt;hu fino&#39; Chamoruyi gui&#39;&amp;hellip;ya siña ha komprendi yu&#39;?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;well, I certainly can&amp;rsquo;t blame them - at least I don&amp;rsquo;t want to. They did what they thought was best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tåya&#39; nai na hu silebra esti na ha&amp;rsquo;åni. Ya ti hu tungu&#39; yanggen bai cho&amp;rsquo;gui&#39; ennao.&lt;/em&gt; What I can and will do is give thanks to &lt;em&gt;i manamko&#39;-ta ni&#39; manlå&amp;rsquo;la&#39; durånten i gera.&lt;/em&gt; They were forced into an impossible situation and forced to make difficult decisions. Decisions with ramifications still echoing today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ll end this not with an exclamation of joy, &lt;em&gt;sa&#39; para guåhu, ti minagof esti na ha&amp;rsquo;åni.&lt;/em&gt; Rather, it is a memorial day. A reminder of the courage and tenacity of our people. A reminder that we are still here, fighting for real liberation; for a decolonized status; for independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fanohgi. Fanachu. Fanhassu. Na&amp;rsquo;lå&amp;rsquo;la.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todu ha&#39; para på&amp;rsquo;gu. Bula guinaiya. &amp;mdash; DJT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t lie to you. I get up early every day and just don&amp;rsquo;t want to workout. I know that exercising will make me healthier, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find the strength to do it. BUT I am honestly trying to workout every morning, or at least every day&amp;hellip;or every week, haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already try to eat healthier food: lots of veggies, plenty of fruits, and I try not to eat too much meat (but I do try to eat seafood whenever I can). This past year has been really difficult for us all, and I definitely see a change in my body - and it ain&amp;rsquo;t good! I&amp;rsquo;m trying not to worry &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; much about what I eat, but I know that always eating bad food can wreck my body. I strongly believe that our diets cause more change than the exercises we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as they say: progress is progress. Tomorrow is a new day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all for now. Much love! &amp;mdash; DJT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello to everyone out there! Today is the beginning of Chamorro Month! I know that I don&amp;rsquo;t often write write here, but I promise you I&amp;rsquo;m trying! It&amp;rsquo;s just every day I&amp;rsquo;ve been so busy: too much work, too much school homework, and we&amp;rsquo;re still moving into a new house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ai adai, please lend me your strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely try to write here, especially because it&amp;rsquo;s Chamorro Month. Just remember everyone: keep using the language; keep learning all that you can. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about errors in your writing or your words. It&amp;rsquo;s all good. Just keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biba Chamorro Month! Celebrate all things Chamorro!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all for now. Much love! &amp;mdash; DJT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goodness, apologies for this late blog! Truthfully, I&amp;rsquo;m super busy but there&amp;rsquo;s a good reason for that. Long story short: I&amp;rsquo;m moving soon into a new house, along with my parents and sister. Hopefully I can write soon so I can give an update on life. Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all for now. Much love! &amp;mdash; DJT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyday I use Chamoru in my house with my family, my wife and my son, Lorie and Leo. Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t often use new words with them, but I certainly talk to them in Chamoru. Sometimes I try to use new words, especially with my son, and I can see that everyday he learns a bit more. I know that he can understand when I say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Come here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lets change (your clothes / your diaper)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the door please&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t (touch anything, touch that, scratch, cry, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kiss please&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you hungry?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m proud of him, and honestly I&amp;rsquo;m proud of myself too that I can converse with my family in Chamoru, even if just a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for now. Much love! &amp;mdash; DJT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s a new year and I wanted to share with you my thoughts for my blog for the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few ideas that I think will help expand my Chamoru, and that&amp;rsquo;s to write about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten &amp;amp; made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books I&amp;rsquo;ve read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All things in Tech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve already written about my family but I&amp;rsquo;d like to write about food, books, and tech, especially security in tech. Security isn&amp;rsquo;t what I do at work, but it is something I incorporate into my daily habits - also it&amp;rsquo;s not something I&amp;rsquo;ve seen written about in Chamoru. I got some Chamoru books for Christmas from my wife and her brother, and honestly I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to read them! I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the coming year and to start writing about these topics. And again, let me know if there&amp;rsquo;s any mistakes or comments you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s it for now. If nobody has told you yet, Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much love &amp;mdash; DJT.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Reminiscing on Christmas celebrations of the past.</description>
        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Håfa adai todus hamyu yan Magof Påsgua Nochebuena para siha ni&#39; mañilebra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas time for me today has shifted mostly towards &lt;em&gt;i bandan asaguå-hu. Gi minagåhet, hagas ha&#39; hu silebra Nochebuena yan i familiå-ña.&lt;/em&gt; On my side of the family we tend to split time between my dad&amp;rsquo;s side and my mom&amp;rsquo;s side. Even then, those parties tend to be closer to New Years or after, i.e., my family tends to celebrate Christmas after New Years &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;ya maolek-ña i &amp;ldquo;sales&amp;rdquo; dispues di New Years ki antes, hunggan?&lt;/em&gt; 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guaha bula hinasso-ku siha ginen tiempon Krismas yan i familiå-ku.&lt;/em&gt; It was definitely one of the happiest times of the year for me: &lt;em&gt;bula nengkånnu&#39;, gaigi todu mamprimå-hu gi gima&#39;, ya mangånta yan manmanayuyut ham. Mahålang yu&#39; nu eyu tiempu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss it - more so lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Kasiyas 2020&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;em&gt;guaha taotao ni&#39; kånta i kantan Påsgua Nochebuena. Muna&amp;rsquo;hasso yu&#39; nu i familiå-ku.&lt;/em&gt; It had been so long since I&amp;rsquo;ve heard those songs - about a decade or so as of this writing. Growing up, it was a common sound&amp;hellip;but after my dad&amp;rsquo;s mom passed, things changed. She was the one who always hosted &lt;em&gt;I Nobenan Niño&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Siña hu hunguk eyu na kånta siha trabiha&amp;hellip;: Fanmåtto Manhengge, Kantåyi Gui&#39;, O Patgon Belen, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; Hearing them sing those songs inundated me with memories and I found myself wishing I had spent more time cherishing those moments; wishing I had pictures or footage; wishing my grandma was still alive and we could do &lt;em&gt;i Nobenan Niño&lt;/em&gt; just one more time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>A poem I wrote for Kasiyas 2020.</description>
        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hu tugi&#39; ini na poem para Kasiyas 2020; put hu sohyu&#39; todus hamyu para konsigi fumino&#39; Chamoru. Yanggen malago&#39; hao umegga&#39;, siña hao gi Facebook &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/inestudianchamoru/videos/383447836086968&#34;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; (manaitai yu&#39; gi ~45 minutes 👍🏼) &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;translation below poem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fino-chamoru&#34;&gt;Fino&#39; Chamoru&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mungnga ma’å’ñao fumino’ Chamoru,&lt;br /&gt;
Achokka’ ennao muna’ma’å’ñao hao.&lt;br /&gt;
Achokka’ hinasso-mu na mapput para hågu,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siña un tutuhun på’gu na ha’åni,&lt;br /&gt;
Lao maolek ha’ yanggen ti siña hao.&lt;br /&gt;
Siña un tutuhun hao agupa’ lokkui’,&lt;br /&gt;
Hasso nai, ni ngai&amp;rsquo;an gof atrasao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achokka&#39; gof chaochao i hinanao-mu&lt;br /&gt;
Pat annåkku’ lokkui’, taiguennao para guahu.&lt;br /&gt;
Lao, mungnga nai chumathinassu,&lt;br /&gt;
Yanggen malago&#39; hao ayuda, pues gaigi yu’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ya mangaigi siha lokkui’, todu manga&amp;rsquo;chong-ta;&lt;br /&gt;
Todu taotao guennao huyung ni’ mane’eyak.&lt;br /&gt;
Todu i taotao muna’lå’la’la&#39; i fino’-ta,&lt;br /&gt;
Manmalago’ ham manmanayuda todus gi hinanao-ta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pues na’ågang i bos-mu annai ume&amp;rsquo;eyak hao,&lt;br /&gt;
Achokka’ na tristi pat gof yayas hao,&lt;br /&gt;
Sa’ anngen un usa i fino’ Chamoru,&lt;br /&gt;
Hågu muna&amp;rsquo;lå&amp;rsquo;la&amp;rsquo;la&#39; i kutturå-mu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sa’ hahasso nai…yanggen ti hita, pues håyi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this poem for Kasiyas 2020; I wrote it to persuade people to continue learning to speak Chamoru. If you want to watch, you can on Facebook &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/inestudianchamoru/videos/383447836086968&#34;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; (I read at ~45 minutes 👍🏼).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d prefer not to translate the poem, at least not right &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;I feel it takes away from the overall meaning of the poem. If you&amp;rsquo;d like a translation, get in touch! We can work through it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1st blog is &lt;a href=&#34;https://write.as/davidtaitingfong/adingani-lahi-hu&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve written here, yeah? Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;ve been really busy these past two months. Every day, I do what I typically do: wake up and exercise or eat, then I work, and then I play with my son. It all drains me, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this blog is so that I can share more simple phrases I tell my son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are mistakes in this blog, then tell me please &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;m still a student and learning every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;phrases-i-tell-my-son&#34;&gt;Phrases I Tell My Son&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⬆ &lt;em&gt;go back up to read the phrases&lt;/em&gt; 😁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All love. DJT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day, I see my son running around our house. He&amp;rsquo;s at the front door, then he runs into the room, then he&amp;rsquo;s behind me or right next to me. My goodness, sometimes I can&amp;rsquo;t find the time to relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But honestly, it makes me happy because I&amp;rsquo;m seeing him grow; he&amp;rsquo;s laughing more, he really likes playing with me and my wife, and he&amp;rsquo;s talking so much!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what else he learns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for now // Much love &amp;mdash; DJT&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Chamoru phrases I say to my son.</description>
        <content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: updated 2020-12-22 by removing reference to my since-deleted write.as blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the Chamoru that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using lately is towards &lt;strong&gt;i lahi-hu&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Håcha na såkkan idåt-ña, pues inadingan-måmi ni ti mapput.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share some of those phrases with you and perhaps get some feedback. If you&amp;rsquo;re here then I&amp;rsquo;ll assume you came from Twitter, IG, or some other social media site. Feel free to hit me up on any of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nihi ta tutuhun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sinångan-siha-ni-hu-sangåni-i-lahi-hu&#34;&gt;Sinångan Siha ni&#39; Hu Sangåni i Lahi-hu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phrases I Tell My Son&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Chamoru&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;English&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Nihi ta tulaika i magågu-mu&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s change your clothes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Nihi ta hånao&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hånao! Huyung neni&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Go! Out neni&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hånao yan sodda&#39; si nanå-mu&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Go and find your mom&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Håyi ennao/eyu?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Who is that?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Maila&#39; mågi&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Come here&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Nihi ta baila!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s dance!&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Baila&#39; yan guahu&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dance with me&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mungnga mangassas hao fan&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t scratch yourself please&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mungnga ennao&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t do that&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mungnga kumåti fan&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Please don&amp;rsquo;t cry&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sa&#39; håfa kumåkati hao neni?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Why are you crying neni?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Atan yu&#39;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Look at me&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kao matuhuk hao?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Are you sleepy?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Kao esta yayas hao?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Are you already tired?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely simple phrases that I hope my son will catch on to. &lt;strong&gt;Gi minagåhet, hu tungu&#39; na ha kumprendi na ilek-hu ya ennao ha gof na&amp;rsquo;magof yu&#39;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todu ha&#39; para på&amp;rsquo;gu.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>My first blog; explains why I started this blog.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Buenas yan håfa adai todus hamyu! Guahu i che&amp;rsquo;lun-miyu as David Taitingfong ya ini iyo-ku na blog ni&#39; un taitaitai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to get this space started for some time but, if I&amp;rsquo;m being honest, so many things have gotten in my way - and by many things I mean myself and the plethora of projects that I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to stop accruing. But as they say: &lt;strong&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s no better time than the present&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;hellip;so here we are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog will largely represent my journey in learning the Chamoru language. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and utilize tags and categories as much as possible to keep things organized, but you can expect to see writings of all forms: lessons, poems, sporadic thoughts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that I still consider myself a beginner in this space (particularly when it comes to conversing) so if you read something and think, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ai adai, milachi gi tinigi&#39;-mu&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, then cut me some slack pot fabot. Ya hunggan, siña ha&#39; para un li&amp;rsquo;i&#39; bula na ini, i.e., I&amp;rsquo;ll be switching from English to Chamoru and vice versa. My goal is to use as much Chamoru as possible but ai adai, guaha na biåhi na siña makkat ennao, lao bai hu chagi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you find my writings interesting. Hopefully this journey never ends and we find our paths crossing at some point. Todu ha&#39; para på&amp;rsquo;gu. Fanadahi todus hamyu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bula guinaiya - DJT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
